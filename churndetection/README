Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a bank customer will **stay or leave** (churn) based on their profile and usage behavior.

Built as part of the CodSoft ML Internship program.

How It Works

- Uses the Kaggle [Bank Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction)
- Encodes `Gender` and `Geography`
- Trained using `RandomForestClassifier` with `class_weight='balanced'`
- Predicts churn based on user-entered index

   Credit Score: 716
   Balance: ₹112,609.91
