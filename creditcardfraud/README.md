## Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses Machine Learning to detect fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced credit card dataset. Built as part of CodSoft Internship Program.
## How It Works

- Uses the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Scales transaction amount using `StandardScaler`
- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` with `class_weight='balanced'`
- Allows testing by entering transaction index number (like 541)
